[RFC]: declarations in flow-control headers (if(var x=expr), while(var x=expr))

(Apologies if this is a duplicate --- I looked in the issues but didn't see it.)  (Forked off https://github.com/wren-lang/wren/issues/956#issuecomment-818322960)

Currently, we can say (in wren-cli):
```
> var x
> if(x="yes") System.print(x)
yes
> x
yes
```

I would like to be able to collapse the first two lines together and say:
```
> if(var x="yes") System.print(x)
yes
> x
[repl line 1] Error at 'x': Variable is used but not defined
```
And the same for `while(var x = expr)`.

## Proposed semantics

### `if`

- The variable is in scope only during the body of the `if`.
  - I would also prefer it to be in scope until the end of the else if/else chain, but it would still be useful to me without that.

### `while`

## Pros and cons

Pros:
- Keeps the scope clean.  For me, this is the big one.
- Makes it easier to refer to temporary results
